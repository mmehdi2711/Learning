Problem 3: Online Store Shipping Calculator
TechMart online store has a complex shipping policy based on order value and customer membership. Orders under $50 have a $8.99 shipping fee. Orders between $50-$99.99 have a $4.99 shipping fee. Orders $100 or more get free shipping. However, if the customer is a Prime member, they get free shipping on any order over $25. If the customer is in Alaska or Hawaii, add an extra $15 to whatever shipping fee applies. If the order weighs more than 50 pounds, add an additional $10 surcharge regardless of other factors. Write a program that determines the total shipping cost based on order value, membership status, location, and package weight.
