name = "Mehdi"
print(name)

# notice how it always copies and prints EXCACTLY what is in the quotes


int age = 15
print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")

# f before the quotes allows us to insert variables inside the string using {}

float height = 173.26
print(f"My height is {height} cm.")

# float is like int with the exception that it can hold decimal values. alongslide float, we can also use double.
